# LinkScrapeR

## About

LinkScrapeR (pronounced "LSR") is a web scraper written in the R programming language that downloads all links from a given webpage directly to a user's computer.  LinkScrapeR can be customized to scrape links beginning and ending with specific extensions (e.g., http, www, .pdf, .eps, etc), while ignoring other content.  This is useful when trying to automate the download process of specific files, particularly when downloading these files by hand isn't feasible due to the sheer quantity of links available.
